## Software for analysis of precomputed Lagrangian Pathways from Mercator 1/12th degree ocean model

This is code for analyzing precomputed Lagrangian pathways in the coastal ocean from the  System For Global Ocean Physical Analysis At 1/12Â° as described in https://www.mercator-ocean.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SYSTEM-sheet-_PSY4V3R1_2017.pdf.

The precomputed pathways were made with software from the OceanParcels project (https://oceanparcels.org).  It currently includes the years 2007-2020, but will extended to include through 2022 by the end of the first quarter of 2023.
