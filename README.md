## Software for analysis of precomputed Lagrangian Pathways from Mercator 1/12th degree ocean model

This repository contains code for analyzing precomputed Lagrangian pathways in the coastal ocean from the System For Global Ocean Physical Analysis At 1/12° as described in https://www.mercator-ocean.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SYSTEM-sheet-_PSY4V3R1_2017.pdf.

The data and software will produce estimates of connectivity for indvidual months and climatological months for particles released at 1m, 20m, and 40m depths. The particles can either be fixed to their initial depth or allowed to advect to different depths. 

The precomputed pathways were made with software from the OceanParcels project (https://oceanparcels.org).  It currently includes the years 2007-2020, but will extended to include through 2022 by the end of the first quarter of 2023.  This work is supported by NSF project OCE 1947954.  

The current available data include the coastal oceans of North and South America for all 1/12° separated points from the coast to either depths up to 500m deep or 100km from the coast, whichever is greater. Future data releases will be global.
